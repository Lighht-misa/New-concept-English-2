                                         Not a gold mime
Dreams of finding lost treasure almost came true recently. A new machine called 'the Revealer' has been
invetned and it has been used to detect gold which has been buried in the ground.The machine was used
in a cave near the seashore where - it is said -pirates used to hide gold.The pirate woule often bury gold
in the cave and then fail to collect it.Armed with the new machine,a search party went into the cave hoping
to find buried gold.The leader of the search party was eaxmining the soil near the entrance to the cave when
the machine showed that there was gold undre the ground.
Very,the party dug a hole tow feet deep.They finally found a small gold coin which was almost worthless.
The party then search the whole cave thoroughly but didn't find anything except an empty tin trunk.
In spite of this ,many people are confident that "The Revealer'may reveal something of value fairly soon.
