    A blessing in disguise? 因祸得福？
    The tiny village of Frinley is said to possess a 'cursed tree'.
    Because the tree  was mentions in a newspaper,the number of visitors to Finley has already increased.
    The tree was planted near the church fifty years ago, but it is only recent years that it has gained(获得)
    an evil reputation.It is said that if anyone touches the tree,he will have bad luck;if anyone picks a leaf,
    he will die.Many villagers believe that the tree has already claimed a number of victims(受害者).
    The vicar(牧师) has been asked to have the tree cut down,but so far he has refused.
    He has pointed out that the tree is a useful source of income,as tourists have been coming from all the parts of the country to see it.
    In spite of  all that has been said,the tourists have been picking leaves and cutting their name on the tree-trunk,
    so far,not one of them has been struck down by sudden death!

     In or out进来还是出去
     Our dog,Rex,used to sit outside our front gate and bark.Every time he wanted to  come into the garden he would brak until someone opened the gate.
     As the neighbours complained of the noise,my husband spent weeks training him to press his paw on the latch to let himself in.
     Rex soon became an expert at opening the gate.However,when I was going out shopping last week,I noticed him in the garden near the gate.
     This tiem he was braking so that someone would let him out!Since then,he was developed another bad habit.
     As soon as he opens the gate from the outside,he comes into the garden and waits until the gate shuts.
     Then hs sits and barks until someone lets him out.After this he immdeiately lets himself in and begins barking again.
     Yesterday me husband removed the gate and Rex got so annoyed we have not seen him since.
