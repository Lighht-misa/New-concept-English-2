My friends kept on offering me cigarettes and cigars.They made no effort to hide their amousement whenever I produced a packet of sweets from my pocket.After seven days of this I went to a party.Everyone around me was smoking and I felf extreamely uncomfortable.When my old friends B urged me to accept a cigarette,it was more than I could bear.I took ont guilitily,lit it and smoked with satisfaction. My wife was delighted taht things had returned to normal *once more*(again).Anyway,as B pointed out ,it is the easiest thing in the world to give up smoking.He himself has done it lots of times!
