>在1936年，一个轰炸机坠毁在了在太平洋南部偏远的Wallis岛，距离samoa群岛还有很长一段距离，飞机没有被损坏的很严重，但是过了很多年，这场事故被遗忘了，剩余的飞机残骸也没有被打扰。然后在1989年，事故发生的26年之后，飞机意地在一个小岛的空中调查上被重新发现了。到那时，飞机处于很稀有的合理的状态并且值得抢救。法国政府把让人把飞机包起来并且一部分一部分的运送回国。一群好心人准备修复这架飞机。这架飞机有4个劳斯莱斯幻影的引擎,但是他们只需要修复其中的三台。想象他们的惊喜之情，当他们打开被包裹的包装箱的时候发现这四个引擎仍然处于完美的状态像是糖一样甜。一群蜜蜂已经把发动机变成了蜂窝，它在蜂蜡中被完成地保存了下来。
