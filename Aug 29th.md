>Children who play trunant from school are unimaginative.A quiet day's fishing,or eight hours in a cinema seeing the same film over and over again,is usually as far as they get.They have all been put to shame by a boy who,while playing truant,treavlled 1600 miles.He hitchhiked to Dover and,towards evening,went into a bot to find somewhere to sleep.When he woke up next morning,he discovered that the boat had,in the meantime,travelled to Clalis.No one noticed the boy as he crept off.From there,he hitchiked tot Paris in a lorry.The driver gave him a few biscuits and a cup of coffee and left him just outside the city.The next car the boy stopped didn't take him into the center of Paris as he hoped it would,but to Perpignan on the Frech-Spanish border.There he was picked up by a policeman and sent back to England by the local authorities.He has surely set up a record for the thousands of children who dream of veading school.

>逃学的孩子总是缺乏想象力的。他们最多就是调上一整天的鱼，或者是在电影院一边又一遍的看同样的电影8个小时。他们都被一个在逃学的时候旅游了1600公里的小孩比下去了。
他搭便车到Dover然后接近晚上的时候进了一个船里面睡觉，当他隔天醒来的时候船在这段时间已经开到了Calais。当他爬下船的时候没人注意到他。从这里他搭着卡车的便车到了巴黎。卡车司机给了他一些饼干和一杯咖啡，然后在城外离开了他。小男孩拦下来的下一辆车不像他希望那样愿意带他到市中心，但是把他带到了Peringnan一个法国和西班牙的边境。在那里他被一个警察抓住了然后被本地政府送回英国了。他确确实实打破了一个成千上万梦想着逃学的学生记录。
