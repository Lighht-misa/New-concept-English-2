The future 
At a village fair,I decided to visit a fortune-teller called taidneg.
I went into her tent and she told me to sit down.
After I had given her some money,She looked into a crystal ball and said:
"A relation of yours is coming to see you.She will be arriving this eveing and intends to stay for a few days.
The moment you leave this tent,you will get a big surprise.A woman you know well will rush towards you.
,She will lead you away from this place.That's all"
As soon as I went out the tent,I forgot all about hers word because my wife hurried towardsme.
"Where have you been hiding?"she asked impatiently.
"Your sister will be here in less than an hour and we must be at the station to meet her.
We are lat alreay.
As she walked away,I followed her out of the fair.


Trouble with the Hubble
The Hubble telescope was launched into space ba NASA op April 20,1990 at a cost of over a billion dollars.
Right from the start there was troble with the Hubble.
The pictures it sent were very disappointing because its main mirror was faulty!
NASA is now going to put the telescope right,so it will soon be sending up fortune
astronaut to repair it.The shuttle Endeavour will be taking the astronaut to the Hubble.
A robot-arm from the Hubble will grab the telescope and hold it while the astronaut make necessary pictures of the stars and distant galaxies
that we have ever seen.The Hubble will tell us a great deal about the age and size of the universe.By the time you read this,
this Hubble's eagle eye will have sent us thousand and thousandd of the wonderful pictures.
