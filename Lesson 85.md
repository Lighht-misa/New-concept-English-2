>I have just received a letter from my old school,**informing me(现在分词做定语而不是现在分词作状语)** that my former headmaster,Mr.Prt,will be retiring next week.Pupils of the school,lod and new,will be sending him a present to mark the occasion.All those who have contributed towards the gift will sign their names in a large album which will be sent to the heardmsater's home.We shall all remember Mr.prt for his patience and understanding and for the kindly encouragement he gave us **when we went so unwilllingly to school(当我们非常不情愿地去上学的时候)**.A great many former pupils will be attending a farewell dinner in his honour next Thursday. It is a curious coincidence that the day before his retirement,Mr.prt will have been teaching for a total of forty years.After he has retired,he will devote himself to gardening.For him,this will be an entirely new hobby.But this does not matter,for as he has often remarked,one is never too old to learn.
